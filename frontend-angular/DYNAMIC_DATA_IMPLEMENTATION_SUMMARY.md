## 🎯 What Was Accomplished

### 1. Data Models Created
**Location:** `src/app/models/`

Five comprehensive model files were created with fully-typed TypeScript interfaces:

- **`land.model.ts`** - Land parcels, building locations, and coordinates (3 interfaces)
- **`building.model.ts`** - Buildings, annexes, and network costs (4 interfaces)
- **`rental.model.ts`** - Rental buildings, locations, decisions, flags, and categories (6 interfaces)
- **`school-map.model.ts`** - Study periods, roads, annexes, and spaces (5 interfaces)
- **`displacement.model.ts`** - Displacement processes and compensation (9 interfaces)

**Total:** 27 TypeScript interfaces covering all application data structures

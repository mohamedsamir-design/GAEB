## Quick Verification Queries

### Check Latest 10 Records Across All Tables
```sql
-- Latest Lands
SELECT TOP 10 'Land' AS TableName, LandCode AS Code, CreatedAt 
FROM Lands 
ORDER BY CreatedAt DESC;

-- Latest Buildings
SELECT TOP 10 'Building' AS TableName, BuildingNumber AS Code, CreatedAt 
FROM Buildings 
ORDER BY CreatedAt DESC;

-- Latest Rentals
SELECT TOP 10 'Rental' AS TableName, BuildingNumber AS Code, UpdatedAt AS CreatedAt 
FROM RentalBuildings 
ORDER BY UpdatedAt DESC;

-- Latest Displacements
SELECT TOP 10 'Displacement' AS TableName, RecordNumber AS Code, CreatedAt 
FROM DisplacementRecords 
ORDER BY CreatedAt DESC;

-- Latest School Maps
SELECT TOP 10 'SchoolMap' AS TableName, BuildingCode AS Code, CreatedAt 
FROM SchoolMaps 
ORDER BY CreatedAt DESC;
```

### Count Records in All Tables
```sql
SELECT 'Lands' AS TableName, COUNT(*) AS RecordCount FROM Lands
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Buildings', COUNT(*) FROM Buildings
UNION ALL
SELECT 'BuildingBasicData', COUNT(*) FROM BuildingBasicData
UNION ALL
SELECT 'BuildingAnnexes', COUNT(*) FROM BuildingAnnexes
UNION ALL
SELECT 'NetworkCosts', COUNT(*) FROM NetworkCosts
UNION ALL
SELECT 'RentalBuildings', COUNT(*) FROM RentalBuildings
UNION ALL
SELECT 'DisplacementRecords', COUNT(*) FROM DisplacementRecords
UNION ALL
SELECT 'SchoolMaps', COUNT(*) FROM SchoolMaps
UNION ALL
SELECT 'StudyPeriods', COUNT(*) FROM StudyPeriods
UNION ALL
SELECT 'SchoolRoads', COUNT(*) FROM SchoolRoads
UNION ALL
SELECT 'SchoolAnnexes', COUNT(*) FROM SchoolAnnexes
UNION ALL
SELECT 'SchoolSpaces', COUNT(*) FROM SchoolSpaces;
```

## Testing After Form Submission

### After Adding Building Basic Data
```sql
-- Check the building was created
SELECT * FROM Buildings 
WHERE BuildingNumber = 'YOUR_BUILDING_NUMBER'
ORDER BY CreatedAt DESC;
```

### After Adding Building Annexes
```sql
-- Check annexes were added
SELECT 
    b.BuildingNumber,
    a.AnnexNumber,
    a.TotalFloors,
    a.TotalArea,
    a.CreatedAt
FROM BuildingAnnexes a
INNER JOIN Buildings b ON a.BuildingId = b.Id
WHERE b.BuildingNumber = 'YOUR_BUILDING_NUMBER'
ORDER BY a.CreatedAt DESC;
```

### After Updating Rental Status
```sql
-- Check rental status was updated
SELECT 
    BuildingNumber,
    RentalStatus,
    RentalSubstatus,
    UpdatedAt
FROM RentalBuildings
WHERE BuildingNumber = 'YOUR_RENTAL_NUMBER'
ORDER BY UpdatedAt DESC;
```

### After Adding Displacement Record
```sql
-- Check displacement was created
SELECT 
    RecordNumber,
    DisplacementType,
    PropertyValue,
    CompensationAmount,
    Status,
    CreatedAt
FROM DisplacementRecords
WHERE RecordNumber = 'YOUR_RECORD_NUMBER'
ORDER BY CreatedAt DESC;
```

### After Adding School Road Data
```sql
-- Check school road was created
SELECT 
    sm.BuildingCode,
    sr.MainRoadTypeCode,
    sr.RoadWidth,
    sr.MovementDirectionCode,
    sr.CreatedAt
FROM SchoolRoads sr
INNER JOIN SchoolMaps sm ON sr.SchoolMapId = sm.Id
WHERE sm.BuildingCode = 'YOUR_BUILDING_CODE'
ORDER BY sr.CreatedAt DESC;
```

## Database Cleanup (Use with Caution)

### Delete Test Records
```sql
-- Delete test buildings (example)
DELETE FROM Buildings 
WHERE BuildingNumber LIKE 'TEST%';

-- Delete test displacements
DELETE FROM DisplacementRecords 
WHERE RecordNumber LIKE 'TEST%';

-- Delete recent test entries (last hour)
DELETE FROM Buildings 
WHERE CreatedAt >= DATEADD(hour, -1, GETDATE()) 
AND BuildingNumber LIKE '%test%';
```

### Reset Specific Table (Use with EXTREME Caution)
```sql
-- This will delete ALL data from the table
-- TRUNCATE TABLE Buildings; -- Uncomment to use
-- TRUNCATE TABLE DisplacementRecords; -- Uncomment to use
```

## Using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)

1. Connect to: `(localdb)\MSSQLLocalDB`
2. Find database: `AngularProjectDb`
3. Open New Query window
4. Copy and paste any query above
5. Execute (F5 or click Execute button)

## Using Visual Studio / VS Code SQL Tools

1. Install SQL Server extension
2. Connect to: `(localdb)\MSSQLLocalDB`
3. Select database: `AngularProjectDb`
4. Run queries from this file

## Testing Workflow

1. **Before Form Submission**: Note the current record count
2. **Submit Form**: Use the Angular application
3. **Run Verification Query**: Use appropriate SELECT statement
4. **Verify Data**: Check that new/updated records appear with correct values
5. **Check Timestamps**: Ensure `CreatedAt` or `UpdatedAt` are current

---

**Note**: All queries use proper SQL Server syntax. Adjust table/column names if your schema differs.
